# Rewards Manager Spec, Properties and Analysis

### System Overview

Rewards Manager is a complex system compared to systems seen during the workshops. It's complexity is due to the style the contract is written in. It also maintains and update states in a not-straightforward manner using multiple functions that sometimes interact with other contracts. The contract also has gas-friendly functions which are complex. 


The states of the system are defined by: 

1. `epoch` - 7 days. This measure is used to divide the rewards in discrete equal periods.  
2. `vault` - a vault external contract that handles vault accounting.
3. `user` - address of the user.
4. `token` - address of some reward token.
4. `shares` - the user balance in the vault.
5. `points` - points to track user rewards share.
6. `pointsWithdrawn` - measure the amount of points withdrawn by the user so far for epoch, vault, user, token.
7. `totalPoints` - sum of all points over users.
8. `rewards` - total rewards for the vault.
9. `lastAccruedTimestamp` - last time a vault was accrued for a specific epoch.
10. `lastUserAccrueTimestamp` - last time a vault was accrued for a specific epoch and user.
11. `totalSupply` - tracks the sum of all deposits for a vault at an epoch and used to measure the share of rewards of a user.
12. `lastVaultDeposit` - unused mapping.

The transition between states depends on the correct implementation of these functions: 
1. `startNextEpoch` - only function responsible of updating `epochs` struct and `currentEpoch`.
2. `addReward` and `addRewards`  - only functions responsible of updating `rewards` state.
3. `notifyTransfer` - update `shares` and `totalSupply` after a transaction is recorded in the vault.
4. `getTotalSupplyAtEpoch` - compute `totalSupply` for the corresponding epoch, vault.
5. `getBalanceAtEpoch` - compute `shares` for the corresponding epoch, vault, user.
6. `getVaultTimeLeftToAccrue` return the time left to accrue for the epoch, vault pair.
7. `getUserTimeLeftToAccrue` return the time left to accrue for the epoch, vault, user.
8. `accrueUser` complex function updates: `shares`, `lastUserAccrueTimestamp`, `points` for epoch, vault, user.
9. `accrueVault` complex function updates: `totalSupply`, `lastAccruedTimestamp`, `totalPoints` for epoch, vault.
10. `claimReward` and `claimRewards`-  allow user to claim rewards and updates `pointsWithdrawn` for epoch, vault, token, user.
11. `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochs` - Bulk claim all rewards for one vault from epochStart to epochEnd, requires user has not withdrawn in any previous epoch between epochStart to epochEnd.
12. `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized` - Gas optimized version of the previous function that deletes some `shares` and `points` mappings.



The state variables updates:
1. `currentEpoch` - only updated by `startNextEpoch`, it is always incremented by 1.
2. `epochs` - only updated by `startNextEpoch`, always the new `endTime` = new `startTime` + 1 week and new `startTime` = block.timestamp.
3. `shares` - It's updated in : `notifyTransfer`, `accrueUser` and `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized`. The value is correlated with tokens of the user held in the particular vault, but that accounting part is left to the vault contract itself.
4. `points` - It's updated in : `accrueUser` and `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized`. `accrueUser` increase `points`, `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized` make it zero. It's value is correlated to `share`
5. `pointsWithdrawn` - It's updated in : `claimReward***` functions. It is non decreasing, and can only surpass `points` if `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized` was called
6. `totalPoints` - It's updated in : `accrueUser` and `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized`. `accrueUser` increase `points`, `claimBulkTokensOverMultipleEpochsOptimized` make it zero. It's value is correlated to `share` and should always be greater than sum of `points`.
7.  `rewards` -  It's updated in `addReward*` functions. is non decreasing.
8. `lastAccruedTimestamp` - updated in `accrueVault`.
9. `lastUserAccrueTimestamp` - updated in `accrueUser`.
10. `totalSupply` - updated in `notifyTransfer` and `accrueVault` functions.





## Epoch properties
1. ***High-level property*** - Future Epochs non initialized : currentEpoch < epoch > 0 => epochs[epoch].startTimestamp  = epochs[epoch].endTimestamp = 0
2. ***State transition*** - Next epoch can only start after epochs[currentEpoch].endTimestamp
3. ***High-level property*** - currentEpoch >= epoch > 0 => epochs[epoch].startTimestamp + 604800 = epochs[epoch].endTimestamp
4. ***High-level property*** - currentEpoch >= epoch > 0  => epochs[epoch].startTimestamp <= block.timestamp

Note: Rules for properties 1-4 verified in the spec
